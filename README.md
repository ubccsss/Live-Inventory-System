# Live-Inventory-System

### Getting Started
1. Install NPM
2. `npm install` to install dependencies
3.  `npm start` to run the server and `npm run test` to run the test suite

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?

We're rolling up our sleeves to develop an intuitive and efficient inventory management system for The Cube (ICICS 012), a vital hub for UBC computer science students, especially for affordable food on campus. Students will have a seamless experience of selecting items and checking out with the Square terminal, and the system automatically adjusts the inventory and displays the total cost. Moreover, officers can easily restock by scanning barcodes or entering details manually. Plus, proactive notifications of dwindling inventory levels are integrated into the system, keeping everyone ahead of the game.

### Why is it important?

This project will enhance the efficiency of The Cube, a place where hundreds of granola bars, chips, instant noodles, and frozen desserts are consumed monthly . By simplifying inventory management and integrating it with the checkout process, we can significantly streamline operations, ensuring The Cube always has their stock in check and popular items available. It's an opportunity to make a direct impact on the student community, improving the way The Cube operates and enriching the experience for everyone who uses it.
